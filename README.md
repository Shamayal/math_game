# TwO-O-Player Math Game

This is a 2-player math game that tests your addition skills. It is an OOP-based command-line application build with Ruby.

## How to Play

For each round, a new math question is generated by randomly picking two numbers between 1 and 20. The player whose turn it is, is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they give an incorrect answer. At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game ends when one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game will announce the winner and the total number of correct answers they gave.
